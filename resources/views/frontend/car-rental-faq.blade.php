                Among the popular car choices, BMW is definitely a favorite.
                In Dubai, more so, as it’s perfect for Sheikh Zayed Road as
                well as on the highways stretching across the Emirates. Being
                one of the most scenic places for those seeking a luxurious
                adventure on wheels, BMWs are the most-in-demand cars in
                Dubai. You’ll be driving alongside exotic cars such as
                Porsche, Mercedes Benz, Audi, not to mention a range of sports
                cars.Many tourists and residents in Dubai rent a BMW to soak
                the pleasure of driving a luxurious sedan. The spacious cabin,
                extra legroom, advanced driving and safety features are what
                BMW vehicles are most known for.

                Yes, you can! Most customers rent a luxury sedan in Dubai to
                visit Abu Dhabi and other emirates. It’s definitely the best
                way to explore the UAE. Car rental companies allow their
                vehicles to be driven anywhere in the UAE, barring a few
                locations such as Jebel Hafeet, Jebel Jais and desert areas.
                Be sure to plan your drives in advance to make the most of it.
                Google Maps is your best friend!If you’re planning a trip to
                the Grand Mosque, Louvre or Yas Marina, consider renting for 2
                or more days to offset the additional mileage charge you will
                incur. As most car rentals, including luxury and sports cars,
                come with a standard mileage limit of 250-km per day. Dubai to
                Abu Dhabi is a good 150-km away so you’ll probably be clocking
                over 300 km on the journey back.Best practice: Consult with
                the car rental agency regarding your trip plan for
                suggestions. Additional mileage packages may be available.
