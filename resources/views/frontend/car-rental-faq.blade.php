                                            companies allow their vehicles to be driven anywhere in the UAE, barring a

                                            locations such as Jebel Hafeet, Jebel Jais and desert areas. Be sure to plan

                                            Marina,
                                            consider renting for 2 or more days to offset the additional mileage charge
                                            you
                                            will incur. As most car rentals, including luxury and sports cars, come with
                                            a
                                            standard mileage limit of 250-km per day. Dubai to Abu Dhabi is a good
                                            150-km
                                            away so youâ€™ll probably be clocking over 300 km on the journey back.Best
                                            practice: Consult with the car rental agency regarding your trip plan for
                                            suggestions. Additional mileage packages may be available.
